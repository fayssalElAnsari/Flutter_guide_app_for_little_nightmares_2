## Description
This repository contains a flutter guide app template, it is a non-complete but functional design. The guide app has a `walkthrough` entry and a `terms of use and privacy` entry on the home screen. When the app is launched for the first time the user is redirected automatically to the `walkthrough` screen which contains an entry for every `chapter` or `level` of the famous game `little nightmares 2`. The data is stored locally on the application so there is no obligation to have internet access. There are `interstitial ads` and `native ads` once every two cards. Each card contains a picture of the current game segment and a small description.
